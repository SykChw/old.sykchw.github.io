## About Me
Hello, I'm currently a Research Scholar @ IIIT Bangalore, working on my Masters. My area of research mostly includes Verification of Neural Networks and AI Safety; trying to forge connections between the disparate domains of Machine Learning, Formal Verification and Software Engineering. I also enjoy extending my curiosities into areas like Artificial Life simulations, theories of the mind and other diverse fields when I'm not working. Besides that, I have a great appreciation for storytelling as an art form, and enjoy expressing myself through writing and sketching. 

You can reach out to me via <a href="mailto:sykchw123@gmail.com">mail</a> or find me either on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sykchw/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/SykChw/">Twitter(X)</a>. You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/SykChw/">GitHub</a> account.

I also maintain a secondary blog at <a href="https://sykchw.bearblog.dev/">electric brains üß†</a>, which is mainly to record byte size chunks of exposition about things that catch my fancy and/or other random content that I may be feeling like writing. So in case you are not able to find some content here, you might be able to find it there. This blog contains mostly the longer length technical expositions that I document for my day-to-day benefit.

You can find my blogs [[‚úçÔ∏è blog/index|here]].
