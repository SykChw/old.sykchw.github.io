## About Me
Hello, I'm currently a Research Scholar @ IIIT Bangalore, working on my Masters. My area of research mostly includes Verification of Neural Networks and AI Safety and trying to forge connections between the disparate domains of Machine Learning, Formal Verification and Software Engineering. Beyond the confines of technical rigor, I enjoy extending my curiosities into areas like Artificial Life simulations, theories of the mind and other diverse fields. Besides that, I have a great deal of appreciation for storytelling as an art form, and enjoy expressing myself through writing and sketching. You can find me on my socials like twitter, linkedin below. I also try be easily reachable via <a href="mailto:sykchw123@gmail.com">mail</a>
