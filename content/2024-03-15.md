**Linear Classifiers** take data and draw a linear decision boundary in the output space. In two-dimensional space, these kinds of classifiers will be drawing a simple line, but for higher dimensional spaces, linear classifiers will be dividing the output space into two subspaces using some hyperplane.
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix + b$$
They are exceeding powerful when the dataset is separable by a linear surface. It might not always be useful to model data of any arbitrary complexity with
